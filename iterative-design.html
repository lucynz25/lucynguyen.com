                <p class = "text" >Alongside a small team, I helped design an interactive interface based 
                    on the problem that the emerging startup has. Re-mint was a startup that we worked with,
                    an official secondhand marketplace for fashion brands. We went through the full process of
                     mocking up a solution to the startup’s concept:  (1) sketching ideas of the interface, (2)
                      creating an interactive, high-fidelity prototype, (3) conducting user testing on a 
                      revised prototype, and (4) contacting the start-up. </p>

                    the transaction data to drive new sales. How the interface of the startup will be a space 
                    for all brands, sellers, and customers to interact with one another is a point of difference 
                    that we haven’t seen from other companies and intrigued us to concoct an interface for their particular needs. </p>

                    begin shopping. We then want you to shop specifically for Lululemon clothes and checkout,

                            and helps with expanding on each other ideas. Without my teammates, I wouldn't have improved in
