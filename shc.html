               <p class = "text"> As a designer, I enhanced the usability and overall 
                user experience of the Solutions in Hometown Connections website, effectively 
                highlighting the organization's wide range of programs and services. Collaborating
                 with fellow designers in the team, we began by conducting interviews and in-depth 
                 UX research, and iteratively crafting wireframes for the website. Through an ongoing 
                 feedback loop involving the design manager, product manager, and clients, we refined
                  our designs eventually implementing them on the SquareSpace platform. Every element of
                   the website including information architecture, layout, and creative illustrations 
                   underwent a complete overhaul. </p>
