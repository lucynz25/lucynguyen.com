                highlighting the organization's wide range of programs and services. Collaborating
                 with fellow designers in the team, we began by conducting interviews and in-depth 
                 UX research, and iteratively crafting wireframes for the website. Through an ongoing 
                 feedback loop involving the design manager, product manager, and clients, we refined
                  our designs eventually implementing them on the SquareSpace platform. Every element of
                   the website including information architecture, layout, and creative illustrations

                <p class = "text">Throughout the redesign journey of the Solutions in Hometown Connections website, we encountered a series of challenges stemming from the limitations of the Squarespace platform. These hurdles, while initially daunting, provided us with the opportunity to exercise creativity and innovation in problem-solving.</p>
                <p class = "text">   By identifying workarounds, utilizing custom CSS, and leveraging the platform's strengths, we were able to transform limitations into opportunities. The final result showcases a website that not only meets the organization's objectives but also overcomes technical restrictions to deliver a seamless and engaging user experience.</p>

                                I had the chance to expand my knowledge by learning from my design manager. 
                                Her insights into auto layout and design industry standards were invaluable. 
                                In the future, I'll actively reach out to my mentors and managers for design questions and learning oppportunties.

                            The SHC project highlighted the significance of clear and consistent communication with the client and team members, especially
                            in the context of remote collaboration. In upcoming projects, I will continue to uphold this standard of communication to ensure that everyone remains informed
                            which will enabled us to push forward in achieving project goals.
