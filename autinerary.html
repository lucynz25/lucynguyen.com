                      the support and connectivity of siblings of individuals on the autism spectrum. 
                      The project's scope encompassed the creation of an online forum platform where anyone, 
                      including siblings of those on the autism spectrum could connect, share experiences, 
                      and access valuable resources. This platform was designed to offer siblings a safe and 
                      welcoming space, fostering empathy and understanding among its users. Our ultimate 
                      goal was to provide siblings with a platform where they could access information, advice,
                       and emotional support from peers who shared similar experiences.

                    <p class =  "text"> In just 8 weeks, we developed a discussion forum platform, a cornerstone product for Autinerary. Autinerary, a central hub for autism-related information. 
                      Autinerary offers resources, support, and knowledge for individuals and families navigating the complex world of autism. Our project unfolded week by week, with evolving responsibilities for each team member, myself included as a designer.

                 and then developing prototypes. 
                I was responsible for addressing all design-related queries and decisions
