                    <br>
                    <p class = "text" > This project aimed to address a pressing issue of the lack of 
                      support and connectivity of siblings of individuals on the autism spectrum. 
                      The project's scope encompassed the creation of an online forum platform called <span class = "bolded-parts text">Autinerary's Community</span> where anyone, 
                      including siblings of those on the autism spectrum could connect, share experiences, 
                      and access valuable resources. This platform was designed to offer siblings a safe and 
                      welcoming space, fostering empathy and understanding among its users. <span class = "bolded-parts"> Our ultimate and initial 
                      goal was to provide siblings with a platform where they could access information, advice,
                       and emotional support from peers who shared similar experiences. </span>
                    </p>

                    <p class = "text">
                        As the project evolved, it organically expanded its reach to include a broader community. 
                        <span class = "bolded-parts">In addition to the initial focus on siblings, we recognized the importance of including autistic 
                        individuals themselves, their family members, and anyone in the autism community to be able to use the discussion-forum platform. </span>
                        This expansion allowed us to create a discussion forum platform and support network that welcomed a 
                        diverse range of users, fostering a more comprehensive approach to promoting empathy, understanding, and support for everyone connected to autism.

                I was responsible for addressing all design-related queries and decisions

                        Given the timeline of the project and our specific target users, we were only able to conduct 3+ user interviews.  These interviews played a pivotal role in gaining profound insights into the unique needs and challenges faced by siblings of individuals with autism. Working within a tight timeframe, we synthesized these insights to craft 2 detailed personas. These personas, stemming from the firsthand experiences shared during interviews, now help formulate feature and design ideas for the Autinerary's Community platform.

                        With the sitemap finalized, I moved onto wireframing. All of the designs were done on Figma. Given the focus on building the minimum viable product (MVP) for Autinerary's Community platform, I concentrated on designing the features for only laptop screen resolutions.


                    </p>

                    <p class = "text">
                        Throughout this process, I generated over 10+ low-fidelity wireframes. Within the timely development of the product, I prioritized and selected specific features to be included in the high-fidelity wireframes ensuring a more streamlined approach for developers. The emphasis was on optimizing the platform for an efficient user experience while delivering essential product functionalities within the project's scope.

                              This project was exceptionally fast-paced, making it challenging to ensure that I delivered my best when faced with numerous tasks.
                              I plan to work on my time management skills and employ tools like Trello to efficiently manage multiple tasks, enabling me to navigate tight deadlines more effectively in future projects.

                            In this project, I neglected to consider how my illustrations would translate to a mobile interface. In future projects, I will place a strong emphasis on responsive design, ensuring that my designs adapt seamlessly to a variety of screen sizes.

                          Designing in a short timeframe with a high workload can lead to neglecting the core purpose of the project which is serving the user. In future projects, I will ensure in every step that I prioritized the user's needs and experience.
