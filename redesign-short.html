                    redesigning and coding one page of a simple website with taking accessibility and responsiveness 
                    into account. This process consists of identifying the flaws of the chosen single page of the 
                    website, creating low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes for various screen websites, and 
                    then building a working & responsive website based on those prototypes. </p>

                <p class =  "text"> New Peking's Chinese Restaurant website was the interface that I chose for redesigning. 
                    The un-usability of the website hinders the business from attracting customers and generating additional 
                    revenue through online ordering. Because of the pandemic, online ordering has now become vital to a restaurant’s 
                    sources of revenue so that’s why there are flaws within the website that I want to improve for the restaurant to 
                    reach customers more effectively. </p>

                                    I didn’t realize that integrating fixed elements (i.e margins) causes 
                                    my code to not be dynamic and difficult to revise later. Next time, 
                                    I’ll make sure to integrate elements that make my code fluid.

                                Through this project, I realized how important implementing usable 
                                and accessible design greatly enhances user experiences with the product. 
                                In my responsive design, there are definitely areas that I could improve upon 
                                in the future (i.e using fewer media queries to make my code dynamic). As an aspiring designer, 
                                I hope to find more ways to make my future designs more responsive and visually engaging.

                                The inital website I designed to explain my redesign process inundated viewers with a plethora of information.
                                As an aspiring designer, I have a goal of getting people the information they need as concisely as possible.
