                <p class = "text" >Alongside a small team, I helped design an interactive interface based 
                    on the problem that the emerging startup has. Re-mint was a startup that we worked with,
                    an official secondhand marketplace for fashion brands. We went through the full process of
                     mocking up a solution to the startup’s concept: (1) sketching ideas of the interface, (2)
                      creating an interactive, high-fidelity prototype, (3) conducting user testing on a final, 
                      revised prototype, and (4) contacting the start-up. </p>

                <p class =  "text"> My team had 2 weeks to learn Figma, select a startup to come up with design solutions for, and go through the design process to 
                   create a prototype for them. We chose Re-mint: Re-mint lets fashion brands set up official secondhand marketplaces 
                    so their customers can buy and sell directly with each other. The startup help brands 
                    monetize their resale market. Re-mint offers revenue share on transaction fees and uses 
                    the transaction data to drive new sales. How the interface of the startup will be a space 
                    for all brands, sellers, and customers to interact with one another is a point of difference 
                    that we haven’t seen from other companies and intrigued us to concoct an interface for their particular needs. </p>

                  <li class = 'bullet-style mb-2'>Wireframing: The design process involved the creation of wireframes to visualize the layout and structure of the interface.</li>
                  <li class = 'bullet-style mb-2'>Low-Fidelity Prototypes: Low-fidelity prototypes were developed to provide a basic representation of the interface. Each group member contributed to generating different possible designs.</li>

                  <li class = 'bullet-style mb-2'>User Testing: User testing was conducted using the interactive high-fidelity prototype. Users were provided with tasks and questions to navigate the interface.</li>

                                key issues that would be otherwise missed.

                            Through this project, I realized the importance of communicating with your team members.
                            Communicating with your team drastically prevents repeated decision making & misunderstandings
                            and helps with expanding on each other ideas. Without my teammates, I wouldn't have improved in 
                            some areas of my communication (i.e not feeling like I'm a burden to my teammates when I ask clarifying questions).
