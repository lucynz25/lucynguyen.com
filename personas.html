                <p class =  "text"> A printer solves the problem of people wanting to access 
                    tangible information rather than accessing it from their digital 
                    devices. However, I had a different range of experiences (some good, others bad) 
                    with the Sci-Li printers at Brown University. As printers are an 
                    everyday interface that impacts all undergraduate students, the 
                    goal of this project was to figure out the strengths and pain 
                    points of the interface using the classic UX design process. 
                    Concocting this information can help Brown faculty realize 
                    what changes should be implemented to improve the user 
                    experiences with the printers at Brown University. </p>

                            unnecessary text. I should have type everything into the bigger question: “so 
                            how does this fit into the bigger picture?” Hence, I cut down text in the first copy by more than 60% 
                            and focused on the major points of my project. Going forward, I should focus 
                            more on the insights that will improve my storytelling abilities for others rather than jotting 
                            everything down because it seems important.

                        At first, I explored Sci-Li Printers by what was required for the class project. 
                        As an aspiring product designer, I hope to push myself more so I can consistently polish my UX/UI 
                        skills and expand my UX/UI knowledge.

                        <span class = "takeaways">Communicate with others.</span>
                        As this was my first ever UX project, I shied away from asking others for their 
                        feedback on my questions, empathy maps, and etc. This resulted in me being lost in what direction I was going with
                        my project. Next time, I would reach out to others when I’m confused, stuck ,or lost as 
                        communication is such an important skill a UX designer should have.
