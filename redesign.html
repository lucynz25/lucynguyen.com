                    redesigning and coding one page of a simple website with taking accessibility and responsiveness 
                    into account. This process consists of identifying the flaws of the chosen single page of the 
                    website, creating low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes for various screen websites, and 
                    then building a working & responsive website based on those prototypes. </p>

                <p class =  "text"> New Peking's Chinese Restaurant website was the interface that I chose for redesigning. 
                    The un-usability of the website hinders the business from attracting customers and generating additional 
                    revenue through online ordering. Because of the pandemic, online ordering has now become vital to a restaurantâ€™s 
                    sources of revenue so I want to improve the user experience of the restaurant's website in order for the restaurant to 
                    reach customers more effectively. </p>

                <p class = "text mt-5 mb-5"> I wanted the design to be simple yet intuitive and easy to use. Using Balsamiq Wireframes, I created low-fidelity wireframes for each of the screen sizes that is generally supported (desktop, tablet, mobile respectively). On each of the prototypes, I annotated how I will redesign the original webpage in different screen resolutions with keeping in mind of the existing problems found in New Providence Chinese Restaurant webpage. These wireframes were created through the Balsamiq Wireframes application.

                                    my code to not be dynamic and difficult to revise later. Next time, 
                                    Iâ€™ll make sure to integrate elements that make my code fluid.

                        </li>
            
                        <li class = 'text bullet-style'>
                            <div class = "mb-3">
                                <span class = "takeaways"> Make design usable and accessible.</span>
                                Through this project, I realized how important implementing usable 
                                and accessible design greatly enhances user experiences with the product. 
                                In my responsive design, there are definitely areas that I could improve upon 
                                in the future (i.e using fewer media queries to make my code dynamic). As an aspiring designer, 
                                I hope to find more ways to make my future designs more responsive and visually engaging.

                                <span class = "takeaways">Adapt design for short attention span.</span>
                                The initial website I designed to explain my redesign process inundated viewers with a plethora of information.
                                As an aspiring designer, I have a goal of getting people the information they need as concisely as possible.
